# Bandito
Just like Bandit... but tiny, and portable.

## Introduction
A lightweight containerised clone of OverTheWire's https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/ Bandit wargame. This project was borne as a part of project PWN (Portable Wargame NUC) to be able to deploy and play Wargames, CTFs, and Vulnerable VMs without internet access.

## Methodology
I believe that I can create a reproducible environment to practice Linux skills by utilising Docker, Ansible, Bash, and Python scripting.
Recreating each level of Bandit as I play through them will be similar to creating a writeup but incorporating the system administration and DevOps skills as I use them to help reinforce the learning.

Docker will be used to deploy a fresh instance of Alpine Linux and use Ansible Playbooks to build the Bandito environment level by level. Scripting languages such as Bash and Python will be utilised for automating Operating system-level tasks such as creating files/folders, randomising strings, creating users setting permissions etc.

## Requirements
- Docker - https://www.docker.com/

## Deployment
